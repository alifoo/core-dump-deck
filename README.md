# Core Dump Anki Deck

This deck is design to be used with a spaced-repetition study system called Anki. The purpose of the deck is to review fundamental good practices of programming. This deck assumes that you have familiarity with at least one programming language.

## Download

This deck is still in progress, but you can already download the current version [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1406849867?cb=1762302636922) or clone this repository and import the .apkg in Anki.

The following principles will be added soon.

## SOLID Principles
